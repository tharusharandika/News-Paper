                <h2 class="h2">President Announces New Climate Initiative</h2>
                <hr>
                <p class="reporter">By JAMES R. ELLIOTT | WASHINGTON BUREAU</p>
                <h4 class="h4">
                    WASHINGTON - President Johnson unveiled an ambitious $2 trillion climate change plan yesterday that would transform the nation's energy infrastructure over the next decade, calling it "the most significant investment in our planet's future since the moon landing."
                </h4>
                <p class="p">
                    The proposal, dubbed the "Green New Horizon," would create millions of jobs while rapidly accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources. Key components include:
                </p>
                <ul class="p">
                    <li>Complete decarbonization of the power grid by 2035 </li>
                    <li>Tax incentives for electric vehicle adoption </li>
                    <li>Modernization of public transportation systems</li>
                    <li>Funding for climate resilience projects</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="leftBorder">"This isn't just about saving the planet for future generations—it's about creating good jobs 
                    right now for American workers," the President said during his Rose Garden announcement. </h3>
                <p class="p">Republican leaders immediately criticized the plan as too expensive and government-heavy. 
                    Senate Minority Leader Mark Richardson (R-KY) called it "a socialist wish list that will cripple 
                    our economy." 
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    Meanwhile, environmental groups praised the initiative while urging even more aggressive 
                    action. "This is a good start, but the science demands we move faster," said Sierra Club 
                    executive director Maya Chen.
                </p>
                <h3 class="h3">
                    Local Impact
                </h3>
                <p class="p">
                    For New Yorkers, the plan would mean significant upgrades to subway infrastructure, 
                    expanded bike lanes, and new job training programs in green energy sectors. Mayor Williams 
                    hailed the proposal as "exactly what cities need to combat climate change while rebuilding 
                    our middle class."
